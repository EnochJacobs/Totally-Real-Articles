				<H2>Introduction</H2>
				<p>The practice of ingesting alcoholic substances has been performed by humans for thousands of years. 
				Although some specific cultures and subcultures do choose to abstain from drinking, almost every nation 
				in the world practices the consumption of alcohol. In the year 1920, America attempted to ban alcohol 
				altogether. Though this proved to be a disastrous failure. Rather than stopping Americans from drinking, 
				the Prohibition created a climate rife with lawlessness, violence, and reckless substance abuse. In fact, 
				the Prohibition was so universally harmful to the country that it was lifted only thirteen years later. 
				However, there is still one demographic of people for which Prohibition remains strictly enforced. 
				Americans, age eighteen to twenty-one, are still forbidden from drinking alcohol despite being legal 
				adults in every other regard. This three-year gap may not be nearly as destructive as the blanket ban in 
				the nineteen-twenties, but it is still causing smaller problems that must be addressed. The drinking age 
				in America should be lowered to eighteen years old like in other developed countries, because this will 
				allow youths to start drinking while still under the guidance of their parents.</p>

				<H2>Timing</H2>
				<p>Alcohol is a potent mood-altering substance that can drastically impair an individual’s judgment as 
				well as their coordination and motor skills. So, it may be hard to see why anyone would be in favor of 
				allowing younger less mature people to use it earlier than absolutely necessary. It is fully 
				understandable why one would be wary of allowing such inexperienced people to experiment with potentially 
				harmful substances. But the problem with this admittedly sound seeming reasoning is that experience does 
				not come from time alone. It comes from the very experimentation that we are delaying when we ask someone 
				to wait three more years before drinking. So, when do we want people to first try out drinking alcohol? 
				Twenty-one does have the advantage of age and some degree of maturity on its side, but it often sacrifices 
				something arguably more important. That being the guidance of guardian figures still living with the 
				individual in question. Shayna Herszage makes a salient point on this matter when she notes that “most 
				young adults leave home before they can legally drink, and gain other freedoms all at the same 
				time – including the freedom to make dangerous decisions without the judgment of parents.” <a href="sources.html">(2022)</a> This 
				means that young people are gaining the ability to drink right at the same time as they are gaining the 
				freedom to make riskier, more reckless decisions. Which is probably the worst time for someone to begin 
				trying to establish healthy drinking habits.</p>

			<div class="artiElOdd">
				<H2>The Age of an Adult</H2>
				<p>At what point does someone become mature enough to be considered an adult who is capable of making 
				decisions with real consequences and risk? The truth is a messy reality in which different people mature 
				at different rates. But such a blurry and ill-defined definition is rather unhelpful for a society that 
				must be able to enforce laws that differentiate between children and adults. So, to make the situation 
				simpler for everyone, we have collectively chosen a hard-set age to represent the time when most people 
				are ready to start making their own decisions. For most people here in the United States of America, that 
				age is eighteen. Or rather, it is mostly eighteen. As a nation, we have decided to distribute the freedoms 
				of adulthood into multiple categories. This is not that bad of an idea in general, however the choice to 
				make the legal drinking age be twenty-one should raise a few eyebrows. One must ask why eighteen is 
				considered mature enough to own and operate a firearm, but not old enough to drink. Why is a 
				seventeen-year-old too young to make healthy decisions regarding their body yet they are still old enough 
				to join the military. Why do we permit sixteen-year-olds to operate motorized vehicles traveling at sixty 
				to eighty miles an hour, while at the same time claiming that they are too immature to drink a light beer 
				in the comfort of their own home? The limits we place upon people are general approximations with no 
				definitively correct answer, but we can at the very least compare them to each other to judge if they make 
				sense in context.</p>

				<H2>Opposing Viewpoints </H2>
				<p>Proponents of the current minimum drinking age have made the argument that lowering the minimum age 
				to eighteen will cause an increase in the number of people who drink. They cite the well documented 
				harmful effects of alcohol consumption and express concern for the impressionable youths who would 
				certainly start drinking earlier if they were legally allowed to do so. As just one example, an essay by 
				members of the activist group Mothers Against Drunk Driving wrote “studies show that the 21 law causes 
				those under the age of 21 to drink less and to continue to drink less throughout their 20s.” 
				<a href="sources.html">(Moyse & Fonder, 2011)</a>.  They emphasize the lives saved by the law, as well as numerous public officials 
				that support keeping the law as it is.</p>

			<div class="artiElOdd">
				<H2>Refutation</H2>
				<p>In all fairness, it is almost certainly true that the law has indeed caused many young adults to delay 
				or lessen early drinking. Though one thing that must be considered is that much of our data on the issue 
				is likely skewed, as it is unlikely that many individuals who have engaged in underage drinking will choose 
				to admit to illegal activity on a survey or questionnaire. There are other methods for estimating the amount 
				of alcohol consumed by underage adults of course, but we will never know for sure. All that we do know is 
				that underage individuals are finding ways to subvert the law and get access to alcohol, regardless of what 
				anyone else has to say about the legality of it. For example, in San Francisco California, it was discovered 
				that individuals under the drinking age had been exploiting relaxed restrictions on food delivery apps 
				during the covid pandemic to gain access to on to-go cocktails and premixed drinks <a href="sources.html">(Siddiqui, 2020)</a>. Again, 
				it is important to note that it is nearly impossibly to know how many underage individuals are finding ways 
				to subvert the law to gain access to alcohol. We cannot deny that the twenty-one minimum has saved lives, 
				but it is also worth considering if even more could be saved by allowing young people to drink openly. We 
				could even mitigate the worst of the harm by allowing people younger than twenty-one to register for a 
				drinking permit that could function similar to a driving permit. This would be a document or card that 
				would allow someone to legally drink so long as they are always supervised by at least one sober adult who 
				can vouch for them. This way we can avoid most of the dangers associated with early drinking, while giving 
				young people the freedom to experiment with alcohol in a more controlled environment.</p>

			<div class="artiEl">
				<H2>Conclusion</H2>
				<p>It is time that we acknowledge the competency of younger people and allow them to decide for themselves 
				if they want to drink alcohol or not. We should allow young adults to experiment with using alcohol while 
				they are still under the supervision of their parents and or guardians, so that they can better learn 
				healthy drinking habits before they move out on their own. We need to find better ways of teaching young 
				folk how to drink and find more effective ways of encouraging responsible behavior. It is time we stop 
				treating eighteen-year-olds as both adults and children at the same time, and instead acknowledge them for 
				who they are. Young adults who are fully capable of responsibility but lacking in experience. It is time we 
				allow people to start drinking at eighteen.</p>
